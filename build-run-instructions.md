# Building and Running the Project Locally

## Prerequisites
- Node.js and npm installed

## Steps

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Run in Development Mode
```bash
npm run dev
```
This starts a development server at http://localhost:5173/ (or another port if 5173 is in use).

### 3. Build for Production
```bash
npm run build
```
This creates a `dist` directory with the built files.

### 4. Preview Production Build
```bash
npm run preview
```
This serves the production build at http://localhost:4173/.

## Verification
All commands have been tested and work correctly. The project can be successfully built and run locally.
